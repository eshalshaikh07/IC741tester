# OpAmp741 Tester 🔬

## Introduction 🌟
The **OpAmp741 Tester** is an Arduino-based tool for testing IC741 operational amplifiers in three configurations:
1. **Inverting Amplifier** 🔄
2. **Non-Inverting Amplifier** ➕
3. **Voltage Follower** ⬅️

This project allows users to quickly verify the functionality of an IC741 by following the guided connection instructions and performing automated voltage output checks.

## How It Works 🔧
1. Connect the circuit according to the selected amplifier mode.  
2. Open the Serial Monitor (Baud Rate: 9600).  
3. Select a mode by entering:  
   - **1** → Inverting Amplifier Test 🔄  
   - **2** → Non-Inverting Amplifier Test ➕  
   - **3** → Voltage Follower Test ⬅️  
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to make connections.  
5. Type 'Y' when ready to start the test.  
6. The system will apply a test voltage and measure the output.  
7. The Serial Monitor will indicate whether the IC741 is **GOOD** ✅ or **BAD** ❌.

## Modes and Expected Outputs ⚙️

### 1. Inverting Amplifier Test 🔄
- **Expected Output:** Less than 2.0V for proper operation.

### 2. Non-Inverting Amplifier Test ➕
- **Expected Output:** Greater than 2.5V for proper operation.

### 3. Voltage Follower Test ⬅️
- **Expected Output:** Approximately equal to 2.5V (±0.2V tolerance).

## Troubleshooting 🛠️
- If the output voltage is incorrect, check your wiring and resistor values.  
- Ensure the IC741 is receiving the proper power supply.  
- If the IC repeatedly fails in all tests, try replacing it with a new one.
